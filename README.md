## Project Goal

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. A code script named run_analysis.R that contains all the above actions.
6. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data
